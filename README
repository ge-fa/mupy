===MUPY===

What is Mupy?
======================
Mupy is a Munin Python Parser. It is written in Python and is powered by Django framework.
Its functionality is pretty straightforward. It parses the HTML DOM of a munin site, stores the graphable
data into a db and provides a friendly user interface for retrieving munin graphs.


Munin version compatibility
=====================
Mupy was built on Munin version 1.4.5, but is supports version 2 as well.


Installation Requirements
=====================
Mupy's installation and operation depends on the following modules/packages

* python-django (>=1.4.5)
* python-mysqldb
* python-ldap (if ldap user auth is needed)
* python-beautifulsoup4 (won't work with <4)
* memcached


Installation
====================
1. Untar the package (or clone via git) to your desired location, copy sample_local_settings.py to local_settings.py, apache/django.wsgi.dist to local files ommiting dist and edit loca_settings.py and apache/django.wsgi according to your needs. Pay special attention to:
MUNIN_URL : url that munin welcome page lives, eg. "http://munin.example.com"
MUNIN_CGI_PATH : if images are updated frequently (without the need to visit) then set the cgi path here, eg. "cgi-bin/munin-cgi-graph/"

2. To serve via Apache (static files),
create an alias for the static dir in your apache conf and a WSGI script alias eg.

Alias /static       /<installation_location>/mupy/static
WSGIScriptAlias /      /<installation_location>/mupy/apache/django.wsgi

3. Run syncdb and create an admin user. Admin users have permissions to all nodegroups/nodes/graphs
4. Run ./manage.py parse_munin2 to parse the MUNIN_URL and store data into db. In case you have an older version of munin you have to run ./manage parse_munin
5. Restart Apache (or "touch apache/django.wsgi") and enjoy
